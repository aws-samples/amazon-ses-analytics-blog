## Analyzing Amazon SES event data with AWS Analytics Services

In this post, we will walk through using AWS Services, such as, Amazon Kinesis Firehose, Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight to monitor Amazon SES
email sending events with the granularity and level of detail required to get insights from your customers engage with the emails you send.

This repository contains the pre-requiste CloudFormation for "Step 1: Use AWS CloudFormation to deploy some additional prerequisites" 

You can get started with our sample AWS CloudFormation template that includes some prerequisites. This template creates an Amazon S3 Bucket, an IAM role needed to access from Amazon SES to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.

After the template finishes creating resources, return to the blog for further steps.
